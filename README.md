# chat-tree
Experimental UI for chatting with LLMs. Provides ability to control context by representing the conversation as a graph of nodes, allowing for branching and merging.


TODO
- merge branches
- delete nodes
- quote messages
- pin user message to top on send
- scroll to message on node selection (with directionality) - just need scroll up
- recenter tree on resize
