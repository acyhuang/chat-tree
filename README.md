# chat-tree
Experimental UI for chatting with LLMs. Provides ability to control context by representing the conversation as a graph of nodes, allowing for branching and merging.


TODO
- pin user message to top on send
- scroll to message on node selection (with directionality)
- recenter tree on resize
- fix node hover preview
- merge branches
- fix react flow controls in dark mode
